TITLE: Fully-automated design of dynamic programming schemes for RNA folding with pseudoknots
AUTHORS: Bertrand Marchand, Sebastian Will, Sarah Berkemer, Laurent Bulteau and Yann Ponty

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
The authors present an approach to automate the design of DP pseudoknot prediction algorithms.

The approach sounds interesting, as it generalises various other approaches for pseudoknot prediction, and in some cases it appears that it improves on them, at least in complexity terms (as explained in section 6). 

I feel that the paper would have been much stronger if the authors had made some implementation of the algorithm available, or tested it against other implemented approaches. It is difficult to be entirely convinced that an approach is an improvement if it is very difficult to get it to work in practice. Of course, the algorithm might be very difficult to implement (or just time consuming?), but in this case the authors should probably explain this in the discussion and maybe give some pointers to the issues that may need to be addressed to implement the algorithm.

I also think that the presentation of the paper could probably be improved somewhat if the authors could explain in a bit more detail in the last two paragraphs of introduction what their main result is, what its significance is, and how it improves on competing approaches (e.g. I had to wait to section 6 to get a better idea why the approach could offer a significant improvement on other techniques).

Also, there are a number of typos (e.g. abstract '(a fnte number of)'), which is a bit distracting, and so a careful read plus use of spell-checker might help.

Just one minor comment: the term 'remarkable' seems a bit over used in section 6.

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
The manuscript entitled  "Fully-automated design of dynamic programming schemes for RNA folding with pseudoknots" by Marchand et al. introduces an algorithm that takes as input a set of fatgraphs representing pseudoknotted RNA structures and efficiently determines a best-energy arc annotation. The method is well described, as well as its complexity, limitations, positioning with respect to the state of the art, and possible extensions and applications. It presents many advantages over the state of the art and a solution for automatically determining a dynamic programming scheme for pseudoknot prediction algorithm.

Could the authors elaborate a bit more on the scope of the algorithm? How general is the assumption that the solution belongs to the set of recursive expansions of the input set of fatgraphs?  Could they give examples of concrete usage cases?

The main structural finding of the authors is that expanding the fatgraph with helices of length 5 yields a graph representative of  all possible expansions of the fatgraph (in terms of tree width). I did not fully understood  the implication of this finding for the final solution. Does this imply that the algorithm will systematically output arc-annotations comprising helices shorter  than 6? Is this realistic? Could the authors  elaborate a bit more on the interpretation and implications of this  finding?

TITLE: Fully-automated design of dynamic programming schemes for RNA folding with pseudoknots
AUTHORS: Bertrand Marchand, Sebastian Will, Sarah Berkemer, Laurent Bulteau and Yann Ponty

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
this paper presents a general framework for prediction of RNA secondary structure with complex pseudoknots, using tree decomposition.

The framework is novel and interesting, and the paper is basically well-written.
Although it is difficult to follow theoretical details, the discussions are reasonable and thus the results seem to be correct.

As for Def.2, it seems that results are not presented in the form of Proposition or Theorem.
It would be much better if some results on Def. 2 could be presented in such forms.

Minor comment

The term 'XP' is used in Theorem 1 without explanations.
It would be better if Theorem 1 could be stated without XP (e.g., with $O(n^{tw+1})$).

TITLE: Fully-automated design of dynamic programming schemes for RNA folding with pseudoknots
AUTHORS: Bertrand Marchand, Sebastian Will, Sarah Berkemer, Laurent Bulteau and Yann Ponty

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
The authors propose a general scheme for automating the development of dynamic programming algorithms for structure-sequence alignment and folding of an RNA sequence, where the structural search space is defined by fat-graph models representing specific configuration classes of pseudoknotted RNA structures.  The framework is based on tree decomposition of the fat-graph  models, and efficiently  generalizes some previous algorithms that were designed for specific variants of the problem. The resulting algorithms are parameterized based on the the treewidth of the underlying fat graph.
 
The paper is original and interesting, it is well written and exemplified (except for some fixable comments, given below). The contribution is solid and relevant to WABI scope.

Major comments:

1. Regarding the claim of optimality which is mentioned in various parts of the paper.  This claim needs to be softened a bit and better formalized (or intuitively explained) early in the paper.   You do give some nice, intuitive elaboration on this point in the conclusions section, however that is too late down the paper, thus causing the reader, earlier in the paper, to expect some proof of optimality and then perhaps be disappointed not to find it within the paper. Another option is to keep the intuitive explanation at the end of the paper but refer to it earlier whenever you raise the claim of optimality.
2. Page 23:6, line 204: It would greatly help the reader if the two notations of squares crossed by one or two diagonals were formally defined prior to their use, or introduced via some high-level overview (with a reference to a more detailed explanation down the paper), rather than relying on the reader to understand it by reference to the example in Figure 3. 

Minor comments and typos:

1. Abstract: finte --> finite

3. Page 5, line 163: any of the input fatgraph --> any of the input fatgraphs
4. Page 5, line 157:  you say “biggest bag minus one” but use minimization rather than maximization in the formula
5. Page 7, line 228: smaller or equal than --> smaller than or equal to
6. Page 7, line 241: two…strategy --> two…strategies
7. Page 7, line 247: put it in a canonical form --> represent it in a canonical form  
8. Page 15, line 413: (or there equivalently, shadows) --> you probably meant “their”, in any case please check this sentence for grammar
9. Page 15, line 452: predicts an arc annotations --> predicts arc annotations
